<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>



<p>TuME stands for "Turing machine emulator" and this is what it is
actually aimed to do. The Turing machine is a mathematical model of an
idealized digital computer, described by English scientist Alan Turing
in 1936. Almost every modern book about algorithm theory contains a
thorough, formal description of the Turing machine, so here I will give
only a brief overview, enough to start your experience with TuME. The
Turing machine consists of an infinite length <dfn>tape</dfn> divided
into cells, each containing a symbol from a finite set. The latter set
is called the machine's <dfn>external alphabet</dfn>. One of its
symbol is reserved and called <dfn>empty symbol</dfn>. There is also a

<dfn>head</dfn> over the tape, able to move in both directions (namely <dfn>right</dfn>
and <dfn>left</dfn>), read a symbol from cell below it and write a
symbol to it. When <dfn>head</dfn> attempts to move behind the last
cell of the tape, a new cell is attached to the corresponding end of
the tape, and it is filled with an <dfn>empty symbol</dfn>. That is
how <dfn>tape</dfn> becomes infinite. Machine always reside in a <dfn>state</dfn>



from a finite <dfn>state set</dfn> and operates in a discrete time.
There are two elements of <dfn>state set</dfn> with a special meaning:
an <dfn>initial</dfn> and <dfn>final</dfn> states. The head's
behavior is determined by a set of <dfn>commands</dfn>, each of which
specifies the conditions that must be met at the time <tt>(i)</tt>,
and actions undertaken at <tt>(i+1)</tt>. Previously mentioned <dfn>initial
state</dfn> is supposed to appear only in the conditional part of the
commands, whilst <dfn>final state</dfn> - only in the actions part.
Other states can appear anywhere. Combination of an external alphabet,
state set, tape with a <dfn>word</dfn> on it and a head located
somewhere on it, and current machine state is called <dfn>configuration</dfn>.
A set of commands is called the machine's <dfn>program</dfn>.<br>



During the execution step <tt>(i)</tt>, machine compares currently
observed symbol on tape and current state with those of commands from
its program. When a command matches, it is executed (which means, its
actions are performed at the step <tt>(i+1)</tt>). Now current
symbol/state are compared with the program data and the process
continues... It halts due to one of the following conditions: </p>

<ol>
<li>Current state is the <dfn>final state</dfn>. As long as it is
not supposed to be met in conditional part of any command, it will
always lead to the end of execution. Such end can be called
"successful". Machine is then called <dfn>applicable to the word on
tape in initial configuration</dfn>.</li><li>Current state is <strong>not</strong> the <dfn>final state</dfn>



but, still, there is no command in program for machine's current
configuration. It's a faulty situation and it means that program is
incorrect. (The same is true for those programs that put machine in
an infinite loop).</li>
</ol>

Besides of algorithm notion formal illustration, Turing machines are
used for computability researches and some other mathematical problems.
This emulator is intended to be a "material" illustration of the Turing
machine itself, as well as debug tool for computer scientists.
<!-- General description, #general -->
<h2 id="general">General description</h2>

<p>TuME is a fast, easy to use tool for running Turing machine programs on multiple platforms, both desktop and mobile. Amongst its
features are the following: </p>

<ul>
<li> Ability to run in <em>automatic mode</em>, - that is, once the program &amp; configuration for machine are specified, emulator
continuously executes commands until it meets a halt condition. You
cannot intervene in machine execution in automatic mode, but You can
suspend execution and continue in step-by-step mode. (However, this is
an unusual case, because an average execution session finishes in a
twinkle of an eye). </li><li> Ability to run in <em>step-by-step mode</em>. In each step You
can observe current configuration and command that will be picked from
the program. Step size can vary from 1 to any number of machine time
units. You can even change current symbol below the head and current
machine state (here and forth such changes will be called "<i>interventions</i>").
  </li><li> Tracing of every step that is done (and interventions performed
by user). </li><li> A handy visualization of the <dfn>tape</dfn>. </li><li> Ability to save/load Turing machine configuration &amp; program description to/from plain text file (in <a href="#tml">TML</a>
format). </li><li> Clear, error-prone configuration &amp; program editor. </li>
</ul>

TuME might be useful to those who study (or teach) algorithm theory as
a visual aid, to mathematicians and computer science researchers, and
to all those geeks who play with their smart phones in subway.

<!-- Edition, #edit -->
<h2 id="edit">Program edition</h2>

<p>Once You have loaded TuME, You can see two tabs at the top of main
window, corresponding to "Emulation" and "Program" sections of the
application. Select the "Program" tab.
Now, at the left side of main window You should see three tabs relating
to&nbsp; “Sets”,
“Commands” and “Tape” subsections of editor. Their content relates to
edition of the
corresponding aspects of machine. Note that, as far as word on <dfn>tape</dfn>


and <dfn>program</dfn> commands depend on <dfn>external alphabet</dfn>
and <dfn>state set</dfn> elements, this aspect should be edited before
the other two. </p>


<h3 id="edit_sets">Sets edition</h3>

<p>Select the "Sets" subsection in the "Program" section, You will see
two lists corresponding to <dfn>state set</dfn> and <dfn>external
alphabet</dfn> edition. Below each of them there is a line of control
elements. To add a new element of the set, write its name into text
field below the corresponding list and press <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Add new &lt;...&gt;" src="qrc:/button/add"> button. To rename the element, select it in the
list, enter new name into text field and press <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Rename &lt;...&gt;" src="qrc:/button/apply"> button. Once the element is renamed in the sets
editor, it will be renamed everywhere it is already in use. To remove
last element, simply press <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Delete last &lt;...&gt;" src="qrc:/button/remove"> button. You cannot
delete an element that is in use somewhere in the <dfn>program</dfn>



or <dfn>tape</dfn>, so alter or remove relative commands and tape
cells first.<br>
<small>Note: restriction to delete only the last element might seem
inconvenient, but remember, that You can achieve same effect by
removing some elements from the tail of the list and then renaming the
others.</small></p>

<h3 id="edit_cmds">Commands edition</h3>

<p>On the "Commands" subsection You shall see a big table in the center
and four buttons below it. The table describes <dfn>program</dfn> of
the machine. Each row refers to a command. There are 6 columns
in the table:</p>

<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%; height: 221px;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">

  <thead style="text-align: center;"><tr>


    <th>Column name</th>

    <th>Editable</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  </thead> <tbody>
    <tr>


      <td style="text-align: center;">Current state<br>
      </td>

      <td style="vertical-align: middle; text-align: center;">yes<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: middle; text-align: left;">A state that machine needs to reside
in at <tt>(i)</tt> for this command to be chosen
      </td>


    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center;">Observed symbol<br>

      </td>
      <td style="text-align: center;">yes<br>
      </td>
      <td>A symbol that must appear below
the <cite>head</cite> at <tt>(i)</tt> for this command to be chosen
      </td>


    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center;">Movement direction<br>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align: center;">yes<br>
      </td>
      <td>Where to move the <cite>head</cite>


at <tt>(i+1)</tt> if this command is executed
      </td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center;">State to switch to<br>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align: center;">yes<br>


      </td>
      <td>A state that machine will switch to
at <tt>(i+1)</tt> if this command is executed
      </td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center;">Symbol to write<br>

      </td>

      <td style="text-align: center;">yes<br>
      </td>
      <td>A symbol that will be written in the cell at <tt>(i+1)</tt> <span style="font-weight: bold;">before</span> the <cite>head</cite> movement performed<br>
      </td>

    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td style="text-align: center;">TML code<br>

      </td>
      <td style="text-align: center;">no<br>
      </td>
      <td>The command represented in TML<br>
      </td>

    </tr>

    
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>To edit a command, select the corresponding cell in the table and
switch to edit mode (it is platform-dependent, e. g., pressing a space
for desktop, pressing a command hard button on a Symbian device, etc.).
From a drop-down list select an appropriate item and leave edit mode.
To add a new row, press <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Add production" src="qrc:/button/add">
button. Newly added rows are highlighted with gray, so that You could
easily identify them. Once such row has been altered, it is no longer
highlighted. To remove a row, select&nbsp;a row You wish to remove (if You won't do, the last one will be removed) and press <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Remove production" src="qrc:/button/remove"> button.<br>
Once You have finished the edition, press <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Apply changes" src="qrc:/button/apply"> button to push the program into machine, or <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Revert changes" src="qrc:/button/clear"> to erase the changes You have made and pull the program from machine to editor.<br>
<small>Note: unlike the other editor subsections, changes made in this one need to be explicitly confirmed by user. If You won't press <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Apply changes" src="qrc:/button/apply"></small> <small>button after edition is completed, machine will still run an obsolete set of commands (although changes won't be dropped until </small><img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Revert changes" src="qrc:/button/clear"><small> button is pressed).</small></p>
<h3 id="edit_tape">Tape edition</h3>
<p>Tape edition subsection allows You to specify initial word on <cite>tape</cite> and initial head position relative to the first symbol on tape. Word on <cite>tape</cite> is presented in the list at the left side of main window. Unlike tape view in the <a href="#emul">emulation section</a>,
symbols here are aligned vertically, leftmost being at the top of the
list and rightmost – at the end. To add a new symbol to the end of the <cite>tape</cite>, select appropriate symbol from the drop-down list at the right part of the window, and press <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Add symbol" src="qrc:/button/add"> button. To change a symbol somewhere on the <cite>tape</cite>, select it in the list, select new symbol from drop-down list and press <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Set symbol" src="qrc:/button/apply"> button. To remove a symbol from the <cite>tape</cite>, select it in the list and press <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Remove symbol" src="qrc:/button/remove"> button.<br>
When You need to change initial offset of <cite>head</cite> from the beginning of the <cite>tape</cite>,
enter it manually to the text field with a spinner at the right side of
the window ("0" points to the first symbol, "1" to the second and so
on). Or You can simply pick the symbol You wish <cite>head</cite> to point to, and press <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Use list selection as offset" src="qrc:/button/navrightm"> button.</p>
<h3>Load and save current program and configuration</h3>
<p>Machine configuration and program can be saved to and load from a single file. Current TuME version supports only text-based <a href="#tml">TML</a>
format, but there will be an option in the future to save/load binary
files as well. TML files can be easily edited from the simplest external text editor, if You dislike the way TuME editor does.<br>
</p>
<ul>

  
  <li>To <em>load a machine</em> (meant, to load its configuration and program) from a TML file, select menu item "File &gt; Open" (marked with <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Open" src="qrc:/action/open">
icon), select the file from Your local file system and open it. In case
of error, current program and configuration remain intact. If an
error occurs during TML parsing process, You will be given a message
with the reason of failure and source file line number, where the error
resides.<br>
    <small>Note, that TuME menu is platform-dependent, so "menu items"
mentioned here relate to a common menu items for a desktop platform, or
a soft button items for mobile platforms.</small><br>
  </li>

  <li>To <em>save the machine</em> to a TML format file, select menu item "File &gt; Save" (marked with <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Save" src="qrc:/action/save"> icon).
Current program and configuration will be saved in the current file, if
any, otherwise You will be asked to select new file name and location.
Menu item "File &gt; Save as" works similar way, but it confirms You
regardless of whether there is a current file or not. Every file that
was recently successfully opened or saved is assumed current.<br>
Beware that application will always save <span style="font-style: italic;">current</span>
machine configuration, even if You have already initiated its
execution. If You need to save the program in its initial
configuration, do so right after edition is completed!</li>
  <li>To <em>create an empty machine</em>, select menu item "File &gt; New" (marked with&nbsp;<img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="New" src="qrc:/action/new"> icon). <cite>Empty machine</cite> has no commands in its program, <dfn>empty symbol</dfn> in external alphabet, <dfn>initial</dfn> and <dfn>final</dfn>
states in state set and a word of a single empty symbol on tape. Right
after TuME have been launched, its machine is also empty.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Once the machine have been saved or loaded, a corresponding restore
point is created (or overwritten, if any). Each time the machine is
reset, its configuration and program will be set to those from restore
point.<br>
</p>
<ul>

</ul>


<h2 id="emul">Emulation</h2>
<p>To begin emulation, go to "Emulation" section by selecting the
corresponding tab at the top of main window. Now You shall see the
emulation screen. Here is a list of components that You shall see here from top to bottom of the screen:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>tape view</em>, displayed as a row of a few (typically 7) cells with an image (typically this: <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Green up pointing arrow" src="qrc:/machine/cursor">) below the cell being currently observed by the head. Cells that are <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> in the tape are displayed white, cells that are <span style="font-style: italic;">potentially</span>
available, are displayed light gray (didn't You forget that the tape is
infinite?). When in focus, tape view is navigable with the keyboard (or
hard buttons):<br>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>right</tt> key scrolls view 1 cell rightwards;</li>
      <li><tt>left</tt> key scrolls view 1 cell leftwards;</li>
      <li><tt>up</tt> key scrolls view until the rightmost <span style="font-style: italic;">real cell</span> appears at the right side of the view;</li>
      <li><tt>down</tt> key scrolls view until the leftmost <span style="font-style: italic;">real cell</span> appears at the left side of the view;</li>
      <li><tt>escape</tt> (or <tt>clear</tt> for mobiles) centers the view around the cell currently being observed by the machine's head.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
  <li id="navpane"><em>navigation pane</em> with the following controls:<br>
    <ul class="controls">
      <li><img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Navigate to left tape border" src="qrc:/button/navbegin"> scrolls view until the leftmost <span style="font-style: italic;">real cell</span> appears at the left side of the view;</li>
      <li><img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Navigate tape left" src="qrc:/button/navleft"> scrolls view 1 cell leftwards;<br>
</li>
      <li><img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Go to cursor" src="qrc:/button/gotocur"> centers the view around the cell currently being observed by the machine's head;</li>
      <li><img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Stop / reset" src="qrc:/button/stop"> <span style="font-style: italic;">(opt.)</span> reverts the machine state to the most recent restore point;</li>
      <li><img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Pause" src="qrc:/button/pause"> <span style="font-style: italic;">(opt.) </span>when automatic execution process is in progress, pauses it, switching to the step-by-step execution mode;</li>
      <li><img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Run" src="qrc:/button/play"><span style="font-style: italic;"> (opt.) </span>starts execution in automatic mode;</li>
      <li><img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Step forward" src="qrc:/button/step"> <span style="font-style: italic;">(opt.)</span> executes machine for the one step (<span style="font-style: italic;">step</span> is not the same as <span style="font-style: italic;">machine time unit</span>, see below);</li>
      <li id="setstep"><strong>number input field</strong> sets the number of <span style="font-style: italic;">machine time units</span> corresponding to one <span style="font-style: italic;">step</span> (typically 1);</li>
      <li><img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Navigate tape right" src="qrc:/button/navright"> <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>scrolls view 1 cell rightwards;</li>
      <li><img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Navigate to right tape border" src="qrc:/button/navend"> scrolls view until the rightmost <span style="font-style: italic;">real cell</span> appears at the right side of the view.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li id="mon_row"><em>monitoring row</em>,
displaying (from left to right) current machine state, symbol on tape,
observed by the head, and a command that matches their combination.
This row is used mainly during execution in step-by-step mode. Current
state and symbol are editable and displayed as currently selected
values in drop-down lists. You can change them by choosing another
values there. Such changes affect only current execution session and
are not saved when the configuration and program are saved or when
reset is performed.</li>
  <li><em>execution trace</em>, a read-only table with a respective
label at the top. Each of its rows relates to a command executed by the
machine. Commands are show in chronological order with the first
executed command at the top of the table. If a sequence of a few
similar commands appears in a trace, they are jammed into two rows: the
first displays the command itself, and the second has all of its
columns set to "..." (ellipsis), assuming "and so on". When at the
machine time unit, corresponding to some row, there was a manual change
of current state or symbol observed by the head, such row is
highlighted with red color (<span style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: red;"> like this </span>).<br>
Here is a detailed description of the table columns:<br>
    <ol>
      <li><tt>Time</tt> – a machine time unit, at which a commands was executed.<br>
      </li>
      <li><tt>State</tt> – in this state machine resided at the <tt>Time</tt> time unit.<br>
      </li>
      <li><tt>Symbol</tt> – this symbol was observed by the machine's head at the <tt>Time</tt> time unit.<br>
      </li>
      <li><tt>Chosen command</tt> – the command that was executed, because it matched a combination of <tt>State</tt> and <tt>Symbol</tt>.</li>
    </ol>
Note, that You can stop tracing of the the execution by checking "Emulation &gt; Disable log" (icon: <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Disable log" src="qrc:/button/log">) menu item. If You do, execution trace will disappear from the screen.</li>
  <li><em>status bar</em>, although is not part of emulation screen, is
especially important here. It contains three (for desktops) or two (for
mobile platforms) sections, from left to right:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Current time</strong>, in machine time units. After
application is loaded or reset performed, displays zero value. When
machine is executed in step-by-step mode, data visible in the
monitoring row relates to the machine time displayed here. After
machine has completed execution in automatic mode, displays (last
command execution time + 1).</li>
      <li><strong>Machine execution status</strong> (desktop TuME
versions only). Displays the reason of the last machine execution
termination. On mobile platforms, this kind of information is placed in
        <span style="font-style: italic;">Current status</span> section, along common application notifications.</li>
      <li><em>Current status</em>. Displays various application-wide information: errors, notifications, etc. On mobile platforms it also shows execution status messages, as execution events happen, prefixed with "<tt>Exec:</tt>".
As far as mobile screen is small, some messages do not fit in this
section. For this reason, on mobile platforms it is performed as
button. Press this button to see the whole message in a separate dialog
box.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

</ul>
<p>Execution control is based on the following menu items in "<em>Emulation</em>" menu:</p>
<ul class="controls">
  <li id="item_reset"><img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Reset" src="qrc:/button/stop"> "<em>Reset</em>" – reverts the machine state to the most recent restore point.</li>
  <li id="item_start"><img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Start" src="qrc:/button/play"> "<em>Start</em>" – resets the machine (see above) and begins its executions in automatic mode.<br>
  </li>
  <li id="item_pause"><img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Pause" src="qrc:/button/pause"> "<em>Pause</em>" – interrupts hanged machine execution, for example, if it entered an infinite loop.</li>
  <li id="item_stepfwd"><img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Step forward" src="qrc:/button/step"> "<em>Step forwar</em>d" – executes machine for a <a href="#setstep">specified</a> count of time units from the current configuration.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If TuME is running on desktop platform, these items have equivalent buttons in <a href="#navpane">navigation pane</a>.<br>
</p>


<h3 id="emul_auto">Running in automatic mode</h3>
<p>Running the machine in automatic mode allows You to test quickly, whether it is <i>applicable to the word on
tape in initial configuration</i>, and acquire results of its execution.<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure the machine is properly <a href="#edit">configured</a>, <a href="#edit_cmds">program</a> is entered and <a href="#edit_tape">tape</a> contains proper word. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Activate menu item "<a href="#item_start">Emulation &gt; Start</a>" (or press <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Run" src="qrc:/button/play"> button, if present).
During the execution, most of the application functions are disabled.
Execution will stop if there is no matching commands in the program or
if execution time limit reached <sup>this feature is not yet implemented</sup>.</li>
  <li>If execution hangs (maybe, same command is being chosen infinitely), You can always stop it by activating menu item "<a href="#item_pause">Emulation &gt; Pause</a>" (or pressing <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Pause" src="qrc:/button/pause"> button, if present).</li>
</ol>
<p>Execution sessions that are finished due to appearance of the <i>final state</i>
in machine configuration are the only that considered successful.
Information in the status bar can help You to determine execution
status. If execution trace was not disabled at the moment of execution
start, it will be available in the emulation screen after the execution
is finished. </p>

<h3 id="emul_sbs">Running in step-by-step mode</h3>
<p>In step-by-step mode You can manually trace the execution, even if it is disabled. Be aware that You cannot enter this mode explicitly – machine always resides in it, except for the periods of automatic execution.
Even when the machine is empty, it stays in step-by-step execution
mode. There are two main actions to control execution&nbsp; in this
mode: step forward (menu item "<a href="#item_stepfwd">Emulation &gt; Step forward</a>") and reset ("<a href="#item_reset">Emulation &gt; Reset</a>"). To execute machine in this mode, do the following:<br>

  <li>Optionally, change a step size (in machine time units) in the <a href="#setstep">"Stride size for step" number input field</a> at the navigation pane in "Emulation" section, if You are not satisfied with the default one, which is 1.</li>
  <li>Optionally, change current machine state and / or currently observed symbol on tape in the <a href="#mon_row">monitoring row</a>.</li>
  <li>Activate "<a href="#item_stepfwd">Emulation &gt; Step forward</a>" menu item (or press <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Step forward" src="qrc:/button/step">
button, if present) one or more times. If You have already debugged
programs, it might resemble You "Step over" debugger command.</li>
  <li>Look at the monitoring row, execution trace (if not disabled) and status bar to see the results.</li>
</ol>
<p>These actions can be undertaken continuously, until You find that the program execution finished.<br>
When machine execution finished, You can reset it to the most recent restore point by activating "<a href="#item_reset">Emulation &gt; Reset</a>" menu item (or pressing <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="Stop / reset" src="qrc:/button/stop"> button, if present).<br>

<h2 id="tml">TML syntax</h2>
<p><abbr>TML</abbr> stands for Turing machine Markup Language. It has
nothing in common with the SGML and its derivatives. It is used for
textual representation of TuME configuration and program, and is not
knows to be used elsewhere.<br>
The TML file consists of three types of lexical elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Directives</em>, that instruct TuME to set a particular machine property to a particular value. Their syntax is simple:
    <div class="code">&lt;directive&gt; ::= &lt;directive-name&gt; ":" &lt;directive-value&gt;<br>
&lt;directive-name&gt; ::= states | alphabet | state0 | state1 | empty | tape | offset<br>
&lt;directive-value&gt; ::= &lt;single-value&gt; | &lt;directive-value&gt; "," &lt;single-value&gt;</div><br>
    <code>&lt;single-value&gt;</code> is an arbitrary string of alphanumeric characters. Spaces withing strings allowed for <cite>symbol</cite> values (symbol set elements, tape symbols) but prohibited for <cite>state</cite> values.<br>
    <code>":"</code> and <code>","</code> symbols allow arbitrary number of spaces or tabulations around them.<br>
  </li>
  <li><em>Commands</em>, that constitute machine's program. Their syntax is:<div class="code">&lt;command&gt; ::= &lt;condition&gt; "-&gt;" &lt;action&gt;<br>&lt;condition&gt; ::= &lt;single-state-value&gt; "(" &lt;single-symbol-value&gt; ")"<br>&lt;action&gt; ::= "(" &lt;single-symbol-value&gt; ")" &lt;movement-dir&gt; "." &lt;single-state-value&gt;<br>&lt;movement-dir&gt; ::= L | S | R</div><br><code>&lt;condition&gt;</code>
is a combination of machine current state and observed symbol on the
tape that are used to test the command for its applicability.<br>
    <code>&lt;action&gt;</code> describes changes in machine that will come to power in case this command is selected.<br>
    <code>&lt;single-state-value&gt;</code> is an arbitrary string of alphanumeric characters without spaces.<br><code>&lt;single-symbol-value&gt;</code> is an arbitrary string of alphanumeric characters.<br><code>&lt;movement-dir&gt;</code> value describes movement direction of the <cite>head</cite>: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">left</span> ("<code>L</code>"), <span style="text-decoration: underline;">right</span> ("<code>R</code>") or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">stand still</span> ("<code>S</code>").<br>
    <code>"-&gt;"</code> symbol allow arbitrary number of spaces or tabulations around it.</li>
  <li><em>Comments</em>, that allow author to leave notes in code.
    <div class="code">&lt;comment&gt; ::= "#" &lt;text-line&gt;</div><br>
    <code>&lt;text-line&gt;</code> is an arbitrary text ended with a newline symbol.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a sample TML code that, when executed, replaces all "<samp>0</samp>" symbols with "<samp>1</samp>" from the beginning of the tape until the first "<samp>1</samp>" is under machine's <cite>head</cite>:</p>
<div class="code"># No arbitrary states - only initial and final<br><br># Valid arbitrary alphabet<br>alphabet: 1<br><br># Mandatory states<br>state0: Q0<br>state1: Q1<br><br># Empty symbol<br>empty: 0<br><br># Tape contents<br>tape:<br>0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1<br><br># Machine commands<br>Q1(0)-&gt;(1)R.Q1<br>Q1(1)-&gt;(1)S.Q0</div>
<h2 id="lims">Limitations</h2>
<p>As it was written in <a href="#intro">introduction</a>, Turing
machine operates with an infinite tape. It is also well-known that
computers operate with finite numbers located in finite memory. This
limitation is especially sensible for mobile devices. TuME tape size is
limited by amount of memory available for a user application on the target platform. Also, as far as TuME counts machine time and traces execution process, execution time is limited by the value <strong>2<sup>64</sup></strong>.
It's a reasonable high value, but it's a divergence from formal
definition given by A. Turing. That's why I'm not sure the application
would fit for all tasks that engage Turing machines.</p>
<p>That's all for now. Your bug reports about TuME are welcome (see below).<br>
